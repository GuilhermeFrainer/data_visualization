        # Welcome
        This project was made for the Visual Analytics for Data Science (CMP273)
        course at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS),
        ministered by professor JoÃ£o Luiz Dihl Comba.

        # Purpose
        Our intention here is to analyze data from multiple hypothesis generation research
        over review datasets (BookCrossing, Yelp and MovieLens).

        This is a difficult problem, since we are dealing with two multidimensional entities
        (reviewer and reviewed entity) in an N:N relationship.

        Our code is open source and available [here](https://github.com/GuilhermeFrainer/data_visualization).
